Various projects exploring various AI and ML models/architectures 

# [1] Project 1: Using Medical MNIST to classify from six classes of various CT scans, as well as generating synthetic images for each class. 

## Problem statement: 
The purpose of this project is to explore fundamental ML architecture and training concepts pertaining to CNNs and GANs, such as as image preprocessing and having a model for use of test/validation of other AI models before scaling. The use of Medical MNIST can also allow for beginners and researchers to understand the nuanaces of medical imaging.  


## Data: 
- Using Medical MNIST found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/medical-mnist/data 
- This dataset consists of 58954 medical images (medical scans of CT, MRI, and Xray) across six classes, with a focus on the body parts of abdomen, breast, chest, hand, head

## Tech Stack: 
- Language: Python
- Deep Learning: PyTorch
- Computer Vision: OpenCV
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Albumentations, and more.


## Approach: 
- Data Insight: Understand the dataset.
- Evaluation Metrics: Grasp the evaluation criteria.
- Architecture Understanding: Unet and Unet++ (for medical applications), DCGAN (for generating synthetic imagery)
- Environment Setup: Get your project environment ready.
- Data Augmentation: Enhance data for better performance.
- Model Building: Create the models with PyTorch.
- Model Training: Trained the model via a GPU 
- Model Prediction: Understand the modular code structure.

## Project Structure: 
- input: Contains data (PNG and TIFF folders).
- src: The heart of the project with modular code, including ML pipelines, engine, and config.
- output: Stores trained models and predictions.
- lib: Reference materials (original iPython notebook).
- requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies.
